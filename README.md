# php-source-code

Learn php source code.


Though have using php for serveral years, still not dig into the php source code. Thus cannot fully understand the principle of the internal php.

So now i'll learn the php through the source code. And i'll remove all the win32 module, or zts module for the perpuse of the 
easy learning.
